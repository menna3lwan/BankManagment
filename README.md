# Bank Management System

Welcome to the Bank Management System project! This project is implemented in Java, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Algorithms. It aims to manage various banking operations efficiently.

## Features

- **Accounts Management**: Handle different types of accounts such as savings, current, and fixed deposits.
- **Transactions**: Perform various transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Loans**: Manage different types of loans like personal loans, housing loans, and installment loans.
- **Cards**: Manage credit and debit cards, including applications and transactions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages and classes, each handling different aspects of the bank management system:

- **Account**: Classes related to bank accounts.
- **Application**: Handles applications for accounts, loans, and cards.
- **Card**: Manages credit and debit cards.
- **Customer**: Stores customer information.
- **Employee**: Manages employee data and operations.
- **Loan**: Handles various loan-related operations.
- **Transaction**: Manages all types of transactions.

## OOP Principles

The project leverages key OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Ensuring data hiding and protecting the internal state of objects.
- **Inheritance**: Creating a hierarchy of classes to promote code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

Efficient data structures and algorithms are implemented to manage operations such as searching, sorting, and managing collections of data.

## File Handling

Robust file handling techniques are used to ensure data persistence and management. Data is stored in files to maintain records of all operations and transactions.
